# RL-snake

• Worked in Python to create a video game and implement a custom game state representation to then apply Reinforcement learning optimally
• Integrated Pygame to create a playable snake game with custom graphics, handling the logic of collisions and movement
• Constructed and trained a DQN model utilizing PyTorch with a learning rate of 0.001 and utilized deque‑based storage for model’s memory
